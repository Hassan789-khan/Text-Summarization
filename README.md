# 🧠 Text Summarization NLP Project

This repository contains my internship project on **Text Summarization**, where I developed a system capable of summarizing lengthy news articles, blogs, and reports into concise summaries.

## 🚀 Objective
To create a system that can automatically generate high-quality summaries using both **extractive** and **abstractive** approaches.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NLTK
- spaCy
- HuggingFace Transformers (BART model)
- CNN/DailyMail Dataset
- ROUGE metric

## 📚 Methods
- **Preprocessing**: Cleaned and normalized raw text
- **Extractive Summarization**: Implemented with `spaCy` and custom sentence scoring
- **Abstractive Summarization**: Powered by HuggingFace’s `facebook/bart-large-cnn` model
- **Evaluation**: Used ROUGE to assess summary quality

## 📌 Outcome
A working NLP model that efficiently summarizes long texts — helpful in content compression, media, and research domains.
